# LearnToSolder2016

## Introduction

For the past couple years, Deanan Schmalz designs a simple circuit board. We then make enouhg boards and buy enough parts to teach all of the 4th graders at Glen Lake Elmementary School in Minnetonka Minnestoa, USA how to solder. 

This site contains all of the information related to this year's Learn To Solder board. If you want to learn more about how to solder, if you want to know what you need to purcahse so you can solder at home, or if you want to make more of these boards for yourself or your organization, this site has everything you'll need.

If you want to reach Brian Schmalz (brian@schmalzaus.com) or Deanna (deanna@schmalzhaus.com) to ask us any questions, please do so. 

This same board design was used at our booth at the 2016 MSP Mini Maker Faire, with one small change in the silk screen text. If you got a board from us at the Maker Faire, all of this information applies as well.

## Tools

To solder electronic kits together, you will need (at a minimum)

### Soldering Iron

We do not recommend buying a soldering iron unless it is 'temperature controlled'. This means you get to set the tip temperature with a knob or buttons, and the iron will only heat up as much as it needs to in order to maintain that temperature. Using a non-temp controlled iron has, in our experience, led to lots of frustration and failed kits.

This is the iorn we recommend, as we've had great experience with it and it is very inexpensive : [http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__19240__Soldering_Station_with_Adjustable_Heat_Range_US_Warehouse_.html]

You can also by this same type of iron from many other places, including Amazon and Ebay, but the price tends to be a bit higher. Some of the companies listed below under Other Soldering Kits also sell tools like irons.

### Solder

For beginners, we strongly recommend using leaded solder (rather than lead-free). The safety risk is very minimal (just be sure to wash your hands with soap when you are done) and it is far, far easier to get good soldered joints with leaded solder when you're just starting to learn soldering. You can buy leaded electronic solder at many online stores like SparkFun [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9161] or Adafruit [https://www.adafruit.com/products/1886]. Make sure to buy 60/40 or 63/37 (those numbers represnet the ratio of tin to lead in the solder) electronic solder - there are other solders out there (like silver solder for jewlrey for example) that won't work for electronics.

### Brass Sponge

When you buy your iron, buy a bras sponge if the iron doesn't already come with it. These are much better than the watter spong that comes with the iron for cleaning the tip of the soldering iron.

### Wire Cutter

All of the companies listed below sell small wire cutters, or you can get them locally at hardware stores too. The best kind is something that will allow you to cut off wires flush with the board - sometimes called 'flush cutters'. For example [https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11952] or [https://www.adafruit.com/products/152]

### Other tools

There are lots of other tools you can get to help you while solder. Third-hands can be very useful. Needle nose pliers, solder suckers, magnifying glasses, solder wick, wire strippers, etc.

## Other Soldering Kits

There are SO MANY kits available today, it's impossible to list all of them, or even the good ones. If you do a Google search for "electronic soldering kit" you will find lots of them out there. Some are easier than others, and some come with great instructions (and some don't).

We buy a lot of high quality soldering kits from the following online companies:
